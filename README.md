# APIDataBase-Project
4 Week Project to expand skills on data base network related to python back end development as well as API


Stock Portfolio Analytics API
This project is a production-style backend API built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL.
The API allows users to securely register and authenticate, manage stock positions, retrieve real-time financial data from external APIs, and compute portfolio performance metrics including total value, allocation breakdown, and percentage gain/loss.
The system is structured using a layered architecture with database persistence, authentication middleware, and external API integration to simulate real-world backend engineering practices.
